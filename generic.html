							<p>This dataset provides comprehensive information about different properties, allowing for analysis and exploration of various factors that may influence property prices, such as size, location, amenities, and condition.</p>
							<h2>BarChart</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/avgpvb1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>For the bar chart showing the average house price by the number of bedrooms. Firstly, the choice of color was crucial in maintaining visual appeal and readability. Opting for a light blue hue ('skyblue') for the bars while contrasting effectively with the black edgecolor. Additionally, to facilitate easy interpretation of price data, the y-axis labels were formatted using the thousands_formatter function, presenting values in thousands and thus streamlining comprehension. Clear and descriptive titles ('Average House Price by Number of Bedrooms') and axis labels ('Number of Bedrooms' for x-axis and 'Average Price' for y-axis) were included to provide context and guide viewers in understanding the chart's content. Overall, these decisions collectively aimed to create a visually appealing and informative visualization that effectively communicates the relationship between the number of bedrooms and average house prices.</p>
							
							<h2>BarChart with highlight</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/avgpvb2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>For the bar chart showing the average house price by the number of bedrooms, I made several decisions to enhance its clarity and visual appeal. Firstly, I used a color gradient to highlight the bar corresponding to the highest number of bedrooms, making it stand out among the rest. This helps draw attention to the most expensive category. Secondly, I adjusted the y-axis major ticks to be at intervals of 200,000 to provide a clear sense of scale and facilitate easy comparison between the bars. I formatted the y-axis labels using the thousands_formatter function to display prices in thousands, improving readability. Overall, these decisions aim to make the chart visually appealing, easy to understand, and effective in communicating the relationship between the number of bedrooms and average house prices.</p>
							
							<h2>BoxPlot</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/avgpvb3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>For the box plot of house prices by the number of bedrooms, I opted for a box plot because it effectively summarizes the distribution of prices within each category of bedrooms. The x-axis represents the number of bedrooms, while the y-axis represents the price of the houses. Each box plot visually communicates the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the price distribution for each number of bedrooms. I chose to format the y-axis labels using the thousands_formatter function to improve readability by displaying prices in thousands. Overall, this box plot provides a clear overview of how house prices vary across different numbers of bedrooms, making it easy to compare the central tendency and spread of prices within each category.</p>
							
							<h2>ScatterPlot</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/avgpvb4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>For the scatter plot of price vs. bedrooms, I chose to represent the relationship between these two variables using a scatter plot because it allows for the visualization of individual data points. The x-axis represents the number of bedrooms, while the y-axis represents the price of the houses. By plotting each data point as a marker on the graph, the scatter plot effectively communicates the distribution of house prices across different numbers of bedrooms.  I applied a custom formatter to the y-axis labels to represent prices in thousands for better readability. Adjusted the x-axis ticks to be spaced at intervals of 3 to improve the presentation of the data. Overall, this scatter plot provides a clear way to understand how house prices vary with the number of bedrooms.</p>
